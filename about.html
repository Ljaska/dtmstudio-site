      <h3>✦ DTM Studio — Diamond Turning Manager</h3>
      <p><strong>DTM Studio</strong> is software developed in Riga by an SPDT machine operator, built specifically for operators. It addresses the everyday workflow on Precitech and Nanotech machines and eliminates the routine steps where most time is wasted or mistakes often occur.</p>

      <p>Instead of manually editing code or switching between multiple utilities, DTM brings everything into one place.</p>

      <h4>What you can do in DTM Studio:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Generate G-code</strong> for specific machines: Precitech (.PGM) and Nanotech (.NC).</li>
        <li><strong>Work with profile corrections (MOD files):</strong> load, select side (Left/Right/Average), scale by percentage, and stack multiple corrections.</li>
        <li><strong>Tool radius support:</strong> programmable Tool Radius is included directly in trajectory calculations, preventing double compensation and ensuring accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Flexible project structure:</strong> when saving, the project stores form, corrections, and applied parameters, so work can be restored without re-entering everything manually.</li>
        <li><strong>Log and error control:</strong> the operator can track every preparation step, reducing the risk of using incorrect parameters.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple file organization:</strong> G-codes, corrections, and project files are saved together in one folder — no need to search across directories.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Why this matters for operators:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Speeds up program preparation:</strong> no need to hand-edit commands or save in different formats.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimizes risk of scrap due to human error:</strong> corrections are applied precisely, and trajectories are validated before loading to the machine.</li>
        <li><strong>Provides a clear, unified workflow:</strong> from profile loading to ready-to-cut code.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>DTM Studio</strong> is not a concept or a “future update.” It is already a working tool that simplifies daily SPDT programming and makes preparation faster, safer, and more reliable.</p>
